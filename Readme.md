This is an analysis of the 1000 genomes open source data using typical bioinformatics tools. I will hopefully be updating with more and more technique and tools with time.

A thorought README has not been made, but each file is somewhat self explenatory and contains reasonably detailed/descriptive comments. The python notebook are any visualizations.

Note to self, run following when commiting:
pip install nbstripout
nbstripout --install
